			<h1>About</h1>
			<h5><i>The world needs visionaries. Those who are able to imagine what’s possible and chart a course to get there.</i></h5>
			<p>
				More than 150 years ago, Claflin broke down barriers in higher education, making it the first South Carolina university open to all regardless of race. Today, Claflin continues to welcome exemplary students of all races and genders who demonstrate a passion to change not only their own circumstances, but to change the world as well.
				We believe that most leaders are made, not born. Furthermore, we believe that students with passion, integrity and a willingness to work hard have an innate capacity to become visionary leaders. As a Claflin student, you be challenged to realize your full potential, leaving here with an unparalleled education that will serve you well in graduate school, in a career – and in life.

			    	<h1>Timeline</h1>
			    	<b>1869</b>
			    	<p>Claflin University was founded and named in honor of Lee Claflin, a prominent Methodist layman from Boston, and his son William Claflin, then governor of Massachusetts. With “the only admission requirements for prospective students being the possession of good moral character and a conscientious desire to learn,” Claflin University offered, for the first time in South Carolina, quality higher education for men and women “regardless of race, complexion, or religious opinion.”
					</p>
					<b>1870</b>
					<p>Dr. Alonzo Webster was appointed the institution’s first president at the first meeting of the Board of Trustees. An outstanding leader, Webster served not only as Claflin’s president, but also as a member of the Board of Trustees, professor of systematic theology and moral and mental philosophy and chief fundraiser.</p>
					<b>1872</b>
					<p>In an effort to strengthen Claflin’s financial base, Webster helped establish an agricultural and mechanical college at Claflin University, the South Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical Institute, on March 12, which assured state funding for the institution through the Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862.</p>
					<b>1874</b>
					<p>Webster resigned as president on June 5, but served as a member of Claflin's Board of Trustees until 1886.
					The Rev. Dr. Edward Cooke, a graduate of Wesleyan University, Harvard University and McKendree College became the second president of Claflin, which saw its enrollment increase to more than 300 students. Under Dr. Cooke's scholarly leadership, the institution was also gaining a reputation for its curriculum.</p>
					<b>1876</b>
					<p>A fire destroyed the main building, adding to the mounting fiscal challenges facing Claflin.</p>
					<b>1877</b>
					<p>Cooke appointed then-special agent of Claflin University, the Rev. Dr. Lewis Marion Dunton, to resolve the fiscal problems of the University through fundraising. Dunton proved to be an adept fundraiser and played an instrumental role in generating support for Claflin in the South, which had previously proven elusive.</p>
					<b>1878</b>
					<p>Claflin's new main building opened. The University also began enrolling students from all over the state, increased its faculty and curriculum, introduced extracurricular activities and installed a replacement library.</p>
					<b>1879</b>
					<p>Claflin bestowed its first honorary degrees, including a Master of Arts degree to Dunton.
					The institution continued to prosper under Cooke. The board proposed the addition of a school of law and a school of medicine. The chair of the law school was former South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Jonathan Jasper Wright.</p>
					<b>1880</b>
					<p>Another much celebrated occasion came in 1882, when the Board of Trustees approved the recommendation that two students, Nathaniel Middleton and William Bulkley, receive bachelor’s degrees. They became the first students to complete the four-year college course offered by the University. After their graduation, Middleton earned an MD degree, becoming a prominent physician in Texas, and Bulkley went on to receive his PhD - becoming the third African-American in the country to do so.

					Along with major fiscal accomplishments, several buildings were erected on campus during the 1880s - Haygood Polytechnic Hall, men’s and women’s dormitories, the Claflin Retail Store, the Matthew Simpson Industrial Home for Girls, the Slater Building and the rebuilt main building.

					After 12 years of service, Cooke retired at age 70, citing poor health.</p>

			    	</h5>
			    	<p>Claflin University will be recognized as a leading 21st Century institution of higher education that develops a diverse and inclusive community of globally engaged visionary leaders.

					It's undeniable -- Claflin is becoming a national university in every sense of the word. Sustained rankings from U.S. News and World Report and other important sources point to the University’s upward trajectory. Indeed, as University leaders continue to position the University toward the goals outlined in our strategic plan -- including academic development, accountability, facilities enhancement and six others -- Claflin is becoming more relevant, more competitive and more effective in preparing the next generation of visionary leaders.
